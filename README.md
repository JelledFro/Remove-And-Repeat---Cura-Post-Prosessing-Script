# Remove-And-Repeat---Cura-Post-Prosessing-Script
A script for removing prints when they are done then make another one, allowing you to automate your printer if you need many identical parts. Just put it in C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.5\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts and find it under "Extensions > post processing > modify G-Code" in Cura. It will probably work best for somewhat tall prints with a small surface area and a glass bed. I've only tested it on my delta, so far. Use at your own risk.
